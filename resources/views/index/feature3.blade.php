        <p class="section-text">
            Writing multi-processed and multi-threaded applications is supported and simplified with a simple and consistent interface. Developer do not longer need to think about forking and creating php threads manually or how to store and clean them. Everything is done automatically using several fallback layers and keeps to work independently.

        <br>
        <p class="section-text">
            Distributed processing between active processes and threads is designed to work as actor-based distribution models do. Processes and threads extends common container class and are treated as separate actors. Each actor can work independently or in cluster. Thanks to shared interface operating on containers does not require from architect to remember which of them are processes and threads.

        <br>
        <p class="section-text">
            To make utterly perfect MT programs developers don't need mutexes, locks, or any other form of inter-thread communication except messages sent across endpoints. With this idea in mind, the whole concept of exchanging information between contaiers is purely message-driven. Framework, by default, ships with several different IPC that programmer can use individually or all-together.
